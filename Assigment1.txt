4.What is a static site?
Ans:A static website consists of a series of HTML files, each of which represents a 
    physical page of the website. On static websites, each page is a separate HTML file.
    When you visit the home page, you are only viewing the file of the actual home page.
    Even if two pages contain a piece of identical content as a footer, the footers exist 
    as two separate versions. So if you want to update the footer, you have to do it on 
    every page.Static websites are fairly simple and all websites were created this way 
    during the early years of the world wide web.

5.What is a dynamic site?
Ans:A dynamic website uses server-side technologies (such as PHP) to dynamically create a 
    web page the moment a user visits the page.
    After entering a certain web address, the server finds a lot of different information,
    which it then writes into a single coherent web page. You can compare a dynamic website
    to a mosaic. This composite web page is then what you will see as a viewer.
    This way of building websites is considered "on the fly" and has several advantages,
    which we will discuss next.
